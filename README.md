# Titanic EDA â€” Task 5

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to extract insights and prepare for modeling. Uses Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.


## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook titanic eda.ipynb
   ```
4. Run cells sequentially. The notebook uses the `seaborn` built-in Titanic dataset, so no external download required.

## Notes
- Missing values exist for `age`, `deck`, and `embark_town`. The notebook shows an example of simple imputation and feature engineering.
- For model building, perform proper preprocessing and cross-validation.
